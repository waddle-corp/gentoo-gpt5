Generally, sterling silver is considered hypoallergenic and is less likely to cause reactions in sensitive skin. However, since the necklace is gold plated, it is important to note that prolonged exposure to moisture or harsh chemicals can affect the plating. \n\nThe materials specified do not indicate the presence of nickel, which is often a common allergen. Therefore, it should be suitable for most individuals with sensitive skin. If you have a known allergy to certain metals, it’s always best to consult with a medical professional before wearing new jewelry. \n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
