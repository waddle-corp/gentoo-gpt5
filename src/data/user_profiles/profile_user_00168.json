            "Content": "While I don't have specific instructional resources or videos available, I can suggest a few basic juggling techniques for beginners that would work well with 'It's A Toss Up' juggling balls:\n\n1. **Start with One Ball**: Practice tossing one ball from one hand to the other. Focus on the height and aim of your toss.\n\n2. **Two Balls**: Once comfortable with one ball, try juggling two balls. Hold one ball in each hand and toss one ball to the opposite hand while the other ball remains in its original hand.\n\n3. **Three Balls**: When you're ready to add the third ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in the other. Toss one ball from your dominant hand, then a ball from your other hand, and finally the second ball from your dominant hand.\n\n4. **Practice**: Consistent practice is key. Work on maintaining a steady rhythm and focus on your catching technique.\n\nYou can find many instructional videos online by searching for beginner juggling tutorials. They often provide visual guidance that can be very helpful!\n\nIf you're interested in purchasing 'It's A Toss Up', it's available for $24.50 at this link: [It's A Toss Up](https://www.aldeahome.com/products/its-a-toss",
